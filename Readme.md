#Portfolio

First Portfolio/Resume website. This portfolio page will list all of the projects I will complete in my studies and help begin a decent coding skills resume! 
At this time,  delve a bit deeper into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and hyperlinks.

# Website UI Gallary

#Here are just a few things I did with CSS:

•	Choose colors of everything on the page, like the background, font, or main menu.
•	Set the size of any element such as font size, the width of the entire site, or an image
•	Change the state of items when hovering over them
